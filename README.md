# Bayes_Rule
This programming excercise displays how to program bayes rule given three inputs.

Bayes' rule can be described as a way to improve a prior belief by incorporating observed data, related to this belief (like test data or sensor measurements). The code involves a function to calculate the posterior probability P(A|B).
